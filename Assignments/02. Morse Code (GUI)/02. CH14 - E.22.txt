14.22 (Morse Code) - DUE 2016.03.25
Perhaps the most famous of all coding schemes is the Morse code, developed by 
Samuel Morse in 1832 for use with the telegraph system. The Morse code assigns
a series of dots and dashes to each letter of the alphabet, each digit, and a
few special characters (e.g., period, comma, colon, semicolon). 

In sound-oriented systems, the dot represents a short sound and the dash a long
sound. Other representations of dots and dashes are used with light-oriented
systems and signal-flag systems. Separation between words is indicated by a
space or, simply, the absence of a dot or dash. In a sound-oriented system, a
space is indicated by a short time during which no sound is transmitted. The 
international version of the Morse code appears in Fig. 14.26.

Write an application that reads an English-language phrase and encodes it into 
Morse code.

Also write an application that reads a phrase in Morse code and converts it
into the English-lan-guage equivalent.

Use one blank between each Morse-coded letter 
three blanks between each Morse-coded word.
