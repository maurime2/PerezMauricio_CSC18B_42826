Implement the program for Chapter 22 Exercise #8
(you will have to do exercise #7 to do this, so I will give an extra week and a few days to complete this).

Due 4/29/16 @ 11:59PM

22.7 (Display a Circle and Its Attributes)
Write a program that displays a circle of random size and calculates and 
displays the area, radius, diameter and circumference. 

Use the following equations: 
	diameter 		= 2 × radius, area =  π  × radius 2
	circumference 	= 2 ×  π  × radius. 
	
	Use the constant Math.PI for pi ( π ). 
	All drawing should be done on a subclass of JPanel, 
	Results of the calculations should be displayed in a read-only JTextArea.


22.8 (Using a JSlider) 
Enhance the program in Exercise 22.7 by allowing the user to alter the radius
with a JSlider. 

The program should work for all radii in the range from 100 to 200. 
As the radius changes, the diameter, area and circumference should be updated
and displayed. The initial radius should be 150. 

Use the equations from Exercise 22.7. All drawing should be done on a subclass
of JPanel, and the results of the calculations should be displayed in a 
read-only JTextArea.
