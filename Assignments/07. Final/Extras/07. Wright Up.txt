Perfection is a bad thing to strive for sometimes...

I started by making my layout, nice and simple. Had all my buttons, and my text boxes, etc..

When it came time to formating the layout, I kept getting stuck in the way theise items were being droped into my 
layout. I must have changed my sesign about 2 times before i gave up, and setteled to go for a BorderLayout. Grid layout was just unsucessfull.

Once i got my layout to work, I set out to create my test cases for my event handlers. This is what I have working:

	- I can list though my pages, by clicking on the Previous and Next buttons, or changing the index number, you can
	  list the different cars on the database.
	
	- You can browse all vehicles in the terminal.
	
	- you can search for any vehicle, any make, any year, any millage on the find section my submitting the info
		through the JTextBox or the find JButton.
		
What's Missing
	- Actual readout to a linkes SQL database. Just Could not do it...
	
	- input of a new item to the database (in my case, the existing array's that hold info)
	
	- Deleting the items from the database (Partialy started)

Each of the event handlers were created to simply start making test cases for each. I know i could finish them if i had more time.
I got too hung up on the layout of the project that i did not allocate enough time to make my test cases which are not all that dificult to implement.

	I would simply null all the deleted data, and move down data higher up in the array down one value, thus simply shifting the data down.
	For adding data, i would do the same, but in reverse, and instedd of null, i would add the data that was inputed into the JTextBoxes for each represented value.
	
All in all, good assignment, just got hung up on the design.
