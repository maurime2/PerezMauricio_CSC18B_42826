14.8 - Tokenizing Telephone Numbers

Write an application that inputs a telephone number as a string in the form of
(555) 555-5555. 

-	The application should use the String class method split to extract:
		* the area code as a token
		* the first three digits of the phone number as a token
		* the last four digits of the phone number as a token.
		
	The seven digits of the phone number should be concatenated into one string. 
	Both the area code and the phone number should be printed. Remember that you 
	will need to change the delimiter characters during the tokenization process.

Implement this program, document it well, and include your correctly completed 
PSP Excel Spreadsheet.
