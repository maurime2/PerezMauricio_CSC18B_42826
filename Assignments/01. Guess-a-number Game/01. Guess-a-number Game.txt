Chapter 12.14 ( Guess-a-number Game )

From Text:

	12.14 (Guess-the-Number Game)
	Write an application that plays “guess the number” as follows:
	
	Your application chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer
	at random in the 1–1000.

	The application then displays the following in a label:

		I have a number between 1 and 1000. Can you guess my number?
		Please enter your first guess.

	- A JTextField should be used to input the guess. 
	
	- As each guess is input, the background should change to either red or 
		blue. Red indicates that the user is getting “warmer,” and “colder.” 
	
	- A JLabel should display either "Too High" or "Too Low" to help the user 
		zero in. 
		
	- The user gets the correct answer, "Correct!" should be displayed, and
		the JTextField used input should be changed to be uneditable. 
		
	- A JButton should be provided to allow the user the game again. 
		When the JButton is clicked, a new random number should be generated
		and input JTextField changed to be editable.

Include the necessary documentation with the PSP Excel Spreadsheet.
