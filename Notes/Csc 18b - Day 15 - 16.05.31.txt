LISTEN AGAIN				
00:45:00	JDBC/DATABASES
			- know about SQL - KEYWORDS, Building simple queries
			- know about database servers (Derby) , creating databases.
			- know JDBC - connection strings, prepared statements
					PREVENTS SQL INJECTION
					BOBBY TABLES - XKCD Comic
			Input Sanitisation important
			
00:48:00	Sub Contracting
				CSV Files - Comma seperated values
			PREPARED STATEMENTS
				A prepared statement is a feature used to execute the
				same (or similar) SQL statements repeatedly with high
				efficiency. Prepared statements basically work like 
				this: Prepare: An SQL statement template is created
				and sent to the database.
